Running Chef Server under passenger and SSL:

To do this, get chef installed on the target machine.

1. From the cookbook root, run:

% rake ssl_cert FQDN=chef.mydomain.com

'mydomain' should be whatever you want to use as your chef server domain. The recipes assume 'chef' as the hostname. Update as necessary.

2. Copy these certificate files to /var/chef/certificates

1. From the root of the cookbooks directory, run:

% chef-solo -c config/solo.rb -j config/server.json
